"I am Kintargo's lord-mayor, yet Kintargo is not my city. Nor is it Cheliax's city. Kintargo belongs to no one person, but to all who live here and make it the greatest city in Cheliax. We call it the Silver City not only for the gleaming waters of the Yolubilis, but for its purity. Kintargo is unique in the nation of Cheliax in this way. We are not the nation's largest city, nor its strongest. We may not have Westcrown's history, Ostenso's naval superiority, Corentyn's trade dominance, or Egorian's power, but nor do we have Westcrown's decay, Ostenso's violence, Corentyn's slaves, or Egorian's damnations. Kintargo is our own, and as Lliira is my witness, I intend to do all I can to ensure our silver shall never tarnish under Thrune's touch."
